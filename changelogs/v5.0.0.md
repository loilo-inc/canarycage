# canarycage v5 Release Notes

## description

Released at 2026/02/06 by [@keroxp](https://github.com/keroxp)

This is fifth major release since the first release, 2018.

Canarycage v5 introduces the brand-new, powerful command: `cage audit`, that finds CVE inside containers which runs in ECS Service.


## cage audit command

In short, `cage audit` is `npm audit`. It does:

- Scan ECS service in the cluster.
- Collect container image's identifier (tag, digest) that are described in Task Definition.
- Query ECR whether they have vulnerabilities.
- Print the result in the CLI.

It's simple, but never found functionality for ECS users.

### Usage

```bash
$ cage audit --region us-east-1 --cluster default --service my-service

```

## misc changes

- Vension number literal has been changed the format with `v` (4.3.1 to v5.0.0).
  - This is for go module version rules.
- `github.corm/apex/log` is now retired.
- `golang.org/xerrors` is now retired.

## breaking changes

There's no breaking changes.

## project structure changes

- Most of CLI-related codes were placed inside `cli/cage/`
