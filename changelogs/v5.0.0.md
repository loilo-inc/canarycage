# canarycage v5 Release Notes

## description

Released at 2026/02/06 by [@keroxp](https://github.com/keroxp)

This is the fifth major release since the first release in 2018.

Canarycage v5 introduces the brand-new, powerful command: `cage audit`, that finds CVEs inside containers running in ECS Service.


## cage audit command

In short, `cage audit` is like `npm audit`. It does:

- Scan ECS services in the cluster.
- Collect container image identifiers (tag, digest) described in Task Definition.
- Query ECR for vulnerabilities.
- Print the results in the CLI.

It's simple, but it's never been found as a feature for ECS users.

### Usage

```bash
$ cage audit --region us-east-1 --cluster default --service my-service
```

```bash
$ cage audit --region us-east-1 ./.deploy/service
```

where `./.deploy/service` is a directory containing `service.json` with `cluster` and `service` fields defined.

```bash
$ cage audit --region us-east-1 ./.deploy/service
```

The `--json` option generates structured audit results.

```bash
$ cage audit --region us-east-1 --cluster default --service my-service --json
```

## misc changes
