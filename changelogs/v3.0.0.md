# canarycage v3.0.0 Release Notes

## description
 
Released at 2019/03/06 by [@keroxp](https://github.com/keroxp)
 
This is first major update from cage was revealed out. There are minimal but several breaking changes. Check out list below.

We believe that cage now become to be very robust, reliable and production-ready tool for deploying container to ECS. We use cage for all production micro services running on ECS Fargate.

üê§Have a happy canary life! 

## breaking changes

- disable `--taskDefinitionBase64` and `--serviceDefinitionBase64` flags for `rollout` command
  - rarely used 
- disable `--skeleton` and `--dryRun` flags for `rollout` command
  - unused
- either `--region` flags or `AWS_REGION` environment variable is required for all commands
  - stop using `us-west-2` as a default region
  - see also: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html
- disable canary service
  - now cage won't create new service as a canary deploy 
  - checking health of next service by launching canary task with identical network configurations to existing service
  - use `startTask` for EC2, `runTask` for Fargate as canary task  
  - this change resolves problems:
    - parallel rolling out can't be run
    - canary service will remain when failed to roll out
- add same flags to `up` command with `rollout`
  - `up` now can accept same flags with `rollout`

## project structure changes

- remove Dockerfile
  - use local `dep`
  - use goreleaser docker image for releasing
